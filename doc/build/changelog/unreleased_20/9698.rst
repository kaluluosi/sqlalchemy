    Added new methods :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncConnection.aclose` as a synonym for
    :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncConnection.close` and
    :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncSession.aclose` as a synonym for
    :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncSession.close` to the
    :class:`_asyncio.AsyncConnection` and :class:` _asyncio.AsyncSession`
    objects, to provide compatibility with Python standard library
    ``@contextlib.aclosing`` construct. Pull request courtesy Grigoriev Semyon.
